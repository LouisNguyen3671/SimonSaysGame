This was a project me and a colleague made on a circuit board we made with a focus on pic16f1829 
The inputs for the project were a touchpad sensor which each cardinal direction representing a letter from my university UTSA (University of Texas at San Antonio)
There are a lot of configs we worked with and the touchpad also had to be set at a certain threshold so it didn't pick up static.
There is a highscore set for how many sequences in a row that the user is able to use 
Other notes are in the source code
